# Brownie-Bot

I am in no way liable for any sort of damages done by this bot. This project is provided AS IS and without warranty. Only use this project for ethical uses ONLY!

# Setup
To use the bot, generate a discord bot token, and enter it into a file called `.env` under the `brownie-bot` directory.

Below is the format that `.env` should follow:
```
# .env
TOKEN=*TOKEN*
```

Next, go to config.json, and set the variables with the appropriate values.
```
"admin user-id": 000000000000000000,
"context channel": 00000000000000000
```
"Admin user-id" is the user id of the user allowed to start/stop the brownie functionality.

"context channel" is the channel id of the channel where screenshots are sent to once they are retrieved.
